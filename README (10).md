Quick multicursor selection
==========

**Extension for Adobe Brackets**

Sublime has this feature that selects the texts that matches the currently selected text, but this feature is not yet in brackets so here it is.

Easily select texts using multiple cursor. Select the text you want to search, select the next match by pressing `Alt+D`, if you want to skip a match press `Alt+S` then type on and edit them simultaneously!
