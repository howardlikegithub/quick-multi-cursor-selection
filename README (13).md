SVG Preview for Brackets
========================
Adds an inline live preview panel when editing SVG files. The preview updates in real time as you type. Works great with [Everyscrub](https://github.com/peterflynn/everyscrub)!

Click the swatches at top to choose a background color for the preview. Use the +/- buttons to zoom and the "1:1" button to reset to 100% scale.

Click any part of the SVG graphic to select the corresponding tag in the code.
